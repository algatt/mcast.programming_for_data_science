# Exercise - Loops and Conditions

## Part 1

1. Print the numbers 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
2. Use a `while` loop to print numbers from 5 to 10.
3. Write an `if-else` statement to check if a number is even or odd.
4. Create a list of 5 fruits, and use a `for` loop to print each fruit in uppercase.
5. Given a list of numbers, use a `for` loop to print every even number.
6. Use a `while` loop and `input()` to collect 3 valid names (not empty) from a user. Print them at the end.
7. Use `if-elif-else` to print the grade (A,B,C,D,F) for a given mark (0 to 100).

## Part 2

8. Given a dictionary with names as keys and ages as values. Print names of all people older than 18.
9. Use a nested `for` loop to print the multiplication tables for numbers 3 to 5.
10. Write a `while` loop that stops after iterating 7 times using a `break` operator.
11. Given a list, use a `for` loop and `if` statement to pint all elements greater than 10.
12. Create a set of 5 random numbers using a loop and use a `for` loop to display all numbers squared. Hint: use `random` package.
13. Given a string use a `for` loop to count how many times the letter `a` appears.
14. Write a `for` loop that iterates over a string and prints each character, except spaces (use `continue`).

## Part 3

15. Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name, and a score, write a loop to print names of people with scores greater than 75.
16. Implement a `while` loop that asks for user input until they type `exit`.
17. Create a dictionary using loops to map numbers from 1 to 10 to their square values. Print all the elements in the set.
18. Given two lists of equal length, use a single `for` loop to print each pair of elements from both lists.
19. Write a script that uses nested loops to print the following pattern:

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

20. Create a list of numbers. Then, using a single loop, create a new list that contains each number squared if the number is even or cubed if the number is odd.

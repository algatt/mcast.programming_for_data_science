# Exercise Functions

## Part 1

1. Write a function to calculate the area of a rectangle. Return the area.
2. Create a function that returns the maximum of 3 numbers. Do not use `max` function.
3. Create a fuction that checks if a number is prime or not. It needs to return `True` or `False`.
4. Write a function to return the reversed value of a string.

## Part 2

5. Create a function that accepts a list of numbers and returns their sum. If an empty list is passed, it must return 0. Do not use `sum` function.
6. Write a function that accepts a dictionary, and prints each key-value pair in the format "`key:value`" on separate lines.
7. Create a function that counts the number of upper case and lower case letters in a string. The function should return a tuple containing the counts (upper_case_count, lower_case_count).
8. Create a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome or not. A palindrome reads the same backwards as forward, e.g. 'radar'.

## Part 3

9. Write a function that accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list without duplicates.
10. Write a function to convert a number to its string representation. For example `1` becomes `1st`, 2 becomes `2nd`... Limit up to 20.
11. Create a function that takes a list of strings, and returns a dictionary with strings as keys, and their length as values.

## Lambda Functions

12. Using a Lambda function, create a small script to sort a list of tuples by the second item. For example, given [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)], it should return [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]. You can use `sorted` function, and use the lambda function in the `key` part of `sorted`.
13. Write a Lambda function, to filter even numbers from a list. You can make use of `filter` function, and pass a `lambda` function as its first parameter.

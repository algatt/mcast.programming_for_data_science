    "# File Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "File handling is an important part of various tasks in Python, such as data analysis, and automation scripts. Python provides built-in functions for reading, writing, and manipulating files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Major File Operations \n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a File\n",
    "\n",
    "`open()` function is used to open a file. It returns a file object, and it takes two arguments: the file name, and the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode determines the purpose of opening a file. Some of the commone modes include:\n",
    "- `'r'`: read mode which is the default\n",
    "- `'w'`: write mode, opens the file for writing, creating the file if it does not exist\n",
    "- `'a'`: append mode, opens the file for writing, appending to the end if it exists\n",
    "- `'b'`: binary mode, opens the file in binary mode used with the previous modes (e.g. `'wb'`, `'rb'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading from a File\n",
    "\n",
    "- `read(size)`: reads up to the specified number of bytes/characters `size` from the file. If `size` is not specified it reads the entire file.\n",
    "- `readline()`: reads a single line from the file\n",
    "- `readlines()`: reads all the lines in a file into a list\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "- `write(string)`: writes the `string` to the file\n",
    "- `writelines(list)`: writes a list of strings to the file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closing the File\n",
    "\n",
    "- `close()`: closes the file. It's important to close unused files to free up system resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `with`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement automatically takes care of closing the file once the nested block of code is executed, even if exceptions are raised within the block."

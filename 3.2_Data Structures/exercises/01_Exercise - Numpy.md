# Exercise Numpy

1. Create a function `generate_temperature` that accepts a `min` and `max` range, and then number of temperatures `count` that need to be created. This function must return a list with `count` temperatures.

2. Create a numpy array `temperature_data` that has 7-day temperature readings for 5 cities. Limit the temperature to be between `15` and `35`.

3. Print the shape of `temperature_data` to ensure its `(5,7)`.

4. Display the overall average_temperature.

5. Display the average temperature per city.

6. Extract the temperature data for the first 3 days of City B, and print them.

7. Create a new numpy array `temperature_f` that has all the values covnerted to fahrenheit. Display the overall average temperature in F.

8. Find the day with the highest temperature for City D. Display the day number, and the relative temperature.

9. Create a new numpy array `all_temps` with a 1D array of all temperatures.

10. For each city, calculate the temperature difference between the highest and the lowest temperatures. Then, display the highest fluctuation.

11. Generate a numpy array `weights` that has 7 values evenly spread out from `0` to `1`. Then multiply these weights with the temperatures.

12. Given a heat index of `[1.1, 1.2, 1.1, 1.3, 1.2, 1.1, 1.2]`, display the total heat index for each city.
